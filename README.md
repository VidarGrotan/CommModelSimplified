# CommModelSimplified

Code to do simulations as described in the paper "An evolutionary and ecological community model for distribution of phenotypes and abundances among competing species".

Please note that the simulations, results and figures in the paper are based on code written in Turbo Pascal. For improved interpretation we have here provided code in R and C+(RccpArmadillo). The code provided here will produce similar (but of course not exactly the same) results as in the paper.

As supplementary material to a paper, this code requires a DOI, and is therefore a "frozen archive". It will therefore not be changed or maintained.
Independently from this archive, the code will however be developed further, with regards to e.g.:
- Efficiency/speed
- Model variants
- More clever choices with regards to "burn-in time" and discretization (dt)
- Utility functions, default arguments
